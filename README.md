## My process
Start with HTML, and then CSS. Struggled a lot because I am still not used to the codes yet.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learnt

```css
body {
background-image : url(); 
background-repeat: no-repeat; 
}
```

### Continued development
I think I will focus on CSS and make more decent-looking websites. I hope I can masater HTML CSS and JavaScript one day soon.
