## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**


## My process
Start with HTML, and then CSS. Struggled a lot because I am still not used to the codes yet.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

```css
body {
background-image : url(); 
background-repeat: no-repeat; 
}
```

### Continued development
I think I will focus on CSS and make more decent-looking websites. I hope I can masater HTML CSS and JavaScript one day soon. 

### Useful resources
I read some codes from other people, and I think that helps me a lot. 

## Author
Just a newbie, no websites or anything else. 

## Acknowledgments
Some people's codes in the solution section helped me a lot, I almost felt overwhelmed because their codes looked brilliant and mine looked long and boring.
